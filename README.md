We have developed an application product as a solution for a problem within the NSBM university system. So as the first step, we observed different sections of our university. As a result, we were able to discover a problem within the hostel management system.  What we discovered was that all the records regarding leaving out and arriving back to university,   of the students who are accommodating inside the NSBM hostel are recorded on a book as a documentarized database. As we all know, documentarized databases have a lot of disadvantages and it is an outdated database type. Based on this problem we discovered, we developed this application mainly considering having all the data records on a computerized system with more added features.
